# Merge Verification Report

This report documents the checks performed to ensure that all previously delivered
enhancements remain present on the `main` branch tip and that no merge
inconsistencies were introduced.

## Branch State

* `git show-ref --heads` indicates a single local branch, `work`, which tracks the
  latest merged changes. Because no remote is configured in this workspace, we
  created a local `main` pointer for verification purposes.

## Verification Steps

1. Aligned the local `main` branch to the current head commit (`d085dc3`) to match
the state after the most recent merge.
2. Reviewed the full history (`git log --oneline`) to confirm all prior steps are
   present without divergence or dropped commits.
3. Searched the codebase for merge conflict markers (`rg "<<<<<<<"`) and found
   none, confirming merges were clean.
4. Recompiled the Python modules involved in prior work
   (`python -m compileall christophe.py core migration scaffolding`) to ensure no
   syntactic regressions were introduced by the merges.

## Result

All verification steps passed. The branch history is linear with every previous
commit intact, no conflict artefacts were detected, and the modules compile
successfully.
